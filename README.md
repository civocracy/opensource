Open-source parts of the Civocracy platform

This repository lists the different sections of the Civocracy platform that are avilable publicly.

Indeed, for certain key parts, a full transparency is required to make sure that the Civocracy platform rules do not have undemocratic effects.
For example, the algorithm used to display content does not use certain type type of data (like gender or age), to segregate content.

The Civocracy platform being open data through its API (https://admin.civocracy.org/api), anybody can verify the algorith results using the code provided in this repository.

For any questions or suggestions, please contact nicolas [Ã ] civocracy.org.
